release 0.9.3
- numerous bug fixes, most importantly regarding the name look-up sequences.
  modules/imports should now work properly (or better at least!)
- (no-argument) constructors are now called on base-classes when a child-class
  is constructed.
- new 'local' keyword to define local variables. (necessary esp. for recursive
  code).
- built-in functions 'name' and 'type' added.
- rudimentary debugger (command-line) now included (devadb). includes basic
  support for stepping, breakpoints, viewing variables, instruction (byte-code)
  level stepping.

release 0.9.2
- slicing added. deva-language-1.0 doc updated to document it. test 47 added to
  test it.
- bug fixes: mixed dot-operator and indexers ('[]' op) were broken in several
  cases. added test cases as well (test 46).

release 0.9.1
- bug fixes: chained assignments generating bad code, function calls as
  conditions cause bad code gen
- (hopefully) builds correctly under Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu/Debian
