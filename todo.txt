TODO 2011-03-09 @deva +high fix minor issues with tests:
	= tests working but needing test fixes:
	55 - relies on ordering of items in maps (baseline contains output of 'print( some_map );' )

	68 (math module NYI)

DONE 2011-03-03 @deva +veryhigh need to unify run-time symbol look-ups - functions should be in the same look-up as variables/classes/etc. - need local vs 'extern' look-up methods ('extern' look-up will follow the scope chain to main, including modules, looking for the symbol)

TODO 2011-02-01 @deva +veryhigh import/modules
	better module/package architecture: allow packages (dirs) of modules? 
	how do modules work? (each module is compiled into a separate code block, which means the 'import' op needs to create the new code block. all fcns in the module are inside this code block, just like the 'main' code block
	BUG: module names aren't being found (ICE in compiler)

TODO 2011-03-02 @deva +veryhigh implement modules (math, bit, os, re et al)

DONE 2011-02-01 @deva +veryhigh overriding/scoping functions doesn't work

	adding a fcn whose name already exists should *override* the existing fcn (map's behaviour is to not accept the new value) problem is that the v1 deva behvariour was to define the fcns as they occurred in the code, not at compile time, so at any point in the code the most recently defined fcn of a given name was called. v2 is defining them at compile time, and by the time the code executes there will only be ONE function of any given name currently this not only behaves incorrectly, but *leaks* subsequent fcns of the same name (see executor.h, line 119)
		SOLUTION: 
		store in an indexable collection that allows duplicates (multi-map)
		as each function is encountered, generate a "make_function" instruction (ala python) which takes 1 arg (the index of the function in the collection) and gets the fcn address from the tos
		execution of the make_function instruction stores this function in the local scope
		change the fcn call code gen to reference the function's index instead of its name as a constant
		===
		functions are currently stored in a map in the Executor, which has a method FindFunction() used to locate them. this needs to become a multi-map and the Find functionality moved to Scope/ScopeTable, which need to have local pointers to the function objects stored in Executor
