The deva language. 

To be done for v1.0.0 release:

- syntactic sugar for slice operations. (slice built-in methods already exist on
  string and vector types).
- list comprehensions: syntactic sugar for (combined) map and filter operations.
- map initializers. currently there are vector initializers (e.g. 'v = [0, 1,
  2];') but not map initializers (something like 'm = {"a" = a, "b" = b};')
- 'buffer' built-in objects to handle reading binary files (embedded nulls).
  right now the read() function will read any given number of bytes, but can 
only return up to the first null, as it returns a string object and deva strings
 are null-terminated
- debugging support: frames, call stack, instruction and line-level stepping.
